        My journey in web development began with a fascination for the for the intersection of design
        and technology. Over the years, I've cultivated a deep understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript,
        along with various front-end frameworks such as React and Angular. Collaboration is the heart
        of my work ethos. I thrive in dynamic enviroments where I can collaborate with cross-functional teams
        to bring ideas to life. By fostering open communication and embracing feedback, I believe in the 
        power of teamwork to unlock creativity and drive innovation.

        I train both boxing and strength training.
        Boxing helps me focus on one thing at a time and pushes
        me to keep getting better. Strength training helps me 
        build the strength I need to keep improving.
        In my free time, I like to hike and read. 
        These activities relax me and give me fresh ideas, 
        especially when it comes to coding.
